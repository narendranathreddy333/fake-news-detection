## Instructions for Running the Project

1. **Ensure the Following Setup:**
   - Make sure that both the data files and Python code (`.py` and `.ipynb` files) are in the **same working directory**.
   - **Python** should be installed on your system. You can verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

2. **Required Libraries:**
   - Import all the required libraries as shown in the code file. If any library is missing, please install it using the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install <library-name>
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     pip install numpy
     pip install matplotlib
     ```

3. **Running the Code:**
   - You can run the code using any Python IDE such as **Jupyter Notebook**, **PyCharm**, or **VS Code**.
   - For `.py` files, use:
     ```bash
     python filename.py
     ```
   - For `.ipynb` files, open them in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially.

4. **Additional Notes:**
   - Ensure that the directory paths and filenames in the code match the actual files in your working directory to avoid errors.
   - Follow the comments and instructions within the code for better understanding and to ensure proper execution.
